Open your themes comments.php file and add this line
if(function_exists(wp_twitip_id_show)) { 
        	 wp_twitip_id_show("auto");
}

You can use "image" or "text" or "user"

"image" = show linked image using image url in settings page
"text" = show text link using anchor text in settings page
"user" = show just the @username
"return" = return the twitter id as a variable for use in custom php
"auto" = show Twitter: @commentluv in a span with class twitter_id 

example:
within the comments loop (foreach($comments as $comment)) I put this below the date output in comments.php
<?php if(function_exists(wp_twitip_id_show)) { 
        	 wp_twitip_id_show("auto");
         }?>
         
"return" = return the twitter id to be used as a variable
example:
<?php if(function_exists(wp_twitip_id_show)) {
		$twitter=wp_twitip_id_show("return");
		if($twitter){
			// has a twitter id
		?>I has a <a href="http://twitter.com/<?php echo $twitter;?>">Twitter Account</a>
		<?php } 
		

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The added field doesn't look like the others on the form =
Inspect the html of your form and see what class has been applied to the field and use that value in the settings page under "field class"

= No field is being added =
Make sure there are no carriage returns (new line breaks) in the code for html before and after field in the settings page

= Can it work with logged on users? =
Yes, as long as they comment at least once and add their ID to the field whilst logged out.

= I was using the beta and now all the previous comments have lost their twitter link =
The beta version saved the values differently. As long as the person makes another comment and add their ID then all comments by them using that email will be updated.

= Do I have to use javascript to add the field? =
No. You can manually add the field to your comment form and select the checkbox on the settings page to not use javascript. (the field needs to have name="atf_twitter_id")

= Anything else? =

Hope you enjoy this plugin!
